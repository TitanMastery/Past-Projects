					<h3>Swedish Massage</h3>
					<p>The main purpose of Swedish massage is to increase the oxygen flow in the blood and release toxins from the muscles. Swedish massage shortens recovery time from muscular strain by flushing the tissues of lactic acid, uric acid, and other metabolic wastes. It increases circulation without increasing heart load. It stretches the ligaments and tendons keeping them supple and pliable. Swedish massage also stimulates the skin and nervous system and soothes the nerves themselves at the same time. It reduces stress, both emotional and physical, and is suggested in a regular program for stress management. It also has many specific medical uses.</p>
					<p>Half Session Swedish Massage (30 minutes) from $44</p>
					<p>Full Session Swedish Massage (60 minutes) from $70</p>
					<p>Session and a Half Swedish Massage (90 minutes) from $95</p>
					
					<h3>Deep Tissue Massage</h3>
					<p>What is Deep Tissue Massage?</p>
					<p>Deep Tissue massage technique that focuses on the deeper layers of muscle tissue. It aims to release the chronic patterns of tension in the body through slow strokes and deep finger pressure on the contracted areas, either following or going across the fibers of the muscles, tendons and fascia.</p>
					<p>Deep tissue massage is used to release chronic muscle tension through slower strokes and more direct deep pressure or friction applied across the grain of the muscles not with the grain. Deep tissue massage helps to break up and eliminate scar tissue, it usually focuses on more specific areas and may cause some soreness during or right after the massage. However, if the massage is done correctly you should feel better than ever within a day or two.</p>
					<p>Why get a Deep Tissue Massage?</p>
					<p>It feels good and it is beneficial to your health. When muscles are stressed, they block oxygen and nutrients, leading to inflammation that builds up toxins in the muscle tissue. A deep-tissue massage helps loosen muscle tissues, release toxins from muscles and get blood and oxygen circulating properly.</p>
					<p>Because many toxins are released, it's important to drink plenty of water after a deep-tissue session to help eliminate these toxins from the body. The purpose is to "unstick" the fibers of a muscle while releasing deeply-held patterns of tension, removing toxins, while relaxing and soothing the muscle. It is both corrective and therapeutic.</p>
					<p>Full Session Deep Tissue Massage (60 minutes) from $85</p>
					<p>Session and a Half Deep Tissue Massage (90 minutes) from $108</p>
					
					<h3>Hot Stone Massage</h3>
					<p>What is stone therapy massage?</p>
					<p>Warm stones used in massage, have been around for a very long time - with evidence of stones being used for healing purposes dating back before written history. This exotic treatment involves the placement of heated polished lava rocks on pressure points and chakra points and the application of heated stones with oil into the skin. Aromatic oils encourage deep relaxation and calm the soul. This therapy is very effective in creating harmony and a positive energy flow thus promoting a sense of balance, energy and peace.</p>
					<p>What are the benefits of stone therapy massage?</p>
					<p>Ancient civilizations believed that hot stones were beneficial in healing in many ways, especially for cleansing the body, relaxing the heart, grounding the soul and soothing the mind. The stones are used to bring relief to tense and sore muscles. As these hot stones glide over the muscles, tensions diminish, and stress gently melts away. Penetrating heat radiates deep into muscles providing relaxation while addressing mental, physical, and spiritual well-being.</p>
					<p>Full Session Hot Stone Massage (60 minutes) from $100</p>
					<p>Session and a Half Hot Stone Massage (90 minutes) from $125</p>
					
					<h3>Pre-Natal Massage</h3>
					<p>Also known as a Pregnancy Massage, Prenatal Massage achieves the same goals as a regular massage. It aims to relax and aide in easing sore or tense muscles. However, a pre-natal massage is tailored to specifically fit the needs of a pregnant woman. Constant body changes during pregnancy create some discomforts. A prenatal massage can help relieve discomforts, including low back pain.</p>
