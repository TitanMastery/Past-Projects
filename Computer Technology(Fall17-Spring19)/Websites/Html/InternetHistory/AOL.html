			AOL emerged from an old over-the-phone game service called GameLine. The company that owned GameLine, Control Video Corporation(CVC), went bankrupt shortly after Steve Case started working there. Jim Kimsey took the remnants of CVC and started his own company called Quantum Computer Services, which still revolved around the idea of selling games. The name was soon changed to AOL as the company began to change direction. Kimsey soon retired and handed the company over to Case. After Case took over, AOL began to offer public access to the internet.

			America Online(AOL) was a service used to publicly access the internet during its early stages. Since its early game services it has developed into a service that provides email, news, and even homework help. They also provided security services for personal computers. Some of the other uses for AOL are:
		</p>
		
		<ul>	
			<li>AIM(instant messenger)</li>
			<li>AOL Video(video sharing service)</li>
			<li>AOL Local(helps users find local info)</li>
			<li>AOL My eAddress(custom domain name for emails)</li>
			<li>Xdrive(cloud storage)</li>
		</ul>

			The internet used to only be accessible to college students/professors, the government, and researchers. Companies like AOL began to sell access to the internet to the public but they had to pay by-the-minute or by-the-hour. Case made the decision in December of 1996 to give unlimited access for only $19.95 a month. People were ecstatic and began to flood AOL services. Other companies soon had to follow suit because they lost so many customers. This completely changed the way people pay for internet access to this day.
