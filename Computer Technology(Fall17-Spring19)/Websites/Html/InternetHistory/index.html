			The history of the internet contains far to much information to fit on this one website. Instead of trying to write about the entirety of the history of the internet, I am going to share two large events that are essential to the development of the internet. Those events are the development of HTML and CSS and how AOL completely revolutionized the way we pay for access to the internet.
