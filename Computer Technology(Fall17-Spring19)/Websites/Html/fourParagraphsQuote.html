<h1 align="center"><u>My Hobbies and Favorite Quote</u></h1>

<p>One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games. I own a PS2, PS3, and a PS4. I have about 120 different video games between the three consoles. </p>

<p>Another one of my favorite hobbies is building computers. I have not had a lot of experience building them since it is such an expensive hobby. I actually taught myself how to build them by taking apart old desktops and putting them back togethter.</p>

<p>The last of my favorite hobbies is writing computer code. I have taken two computer science classes. I learned the basic syntaxes of java and python in those classes and have even coded a few text based games.</p>

<blockquote>"I have destroyed myself to do this. They have taken my Ghost. They are in my blood and brain. But now there is hope. I have made a wound in the Vault. I have pierced it and let in the Light. Bathe in it and be cleansed. Look to it, and understand: From my own Light and from the thinking flesh of the Vex I made a shield. The shield is your deliverance. It will break the unbreakable. It will change your fate. Bind yourself to the shield. Bind yourself to me. And if you abandon your purpose, let the vault consume you, as it consumed me. Now it is done. If I speak again I am not Kabr." -Kabr the Legionless</blockquote>
