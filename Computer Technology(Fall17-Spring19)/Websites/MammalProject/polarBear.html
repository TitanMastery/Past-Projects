		<h2>Polar Bears</h2>
		
		<p id="bodyP">Polar bears are found within the arctic circle. They hunt for food by drifting through the arctic sea on sea ice and attacking seals that get near them. Since they are so reliant on this sea ice for hunting their populations are declining due to the warming of the ice caps.</p>
