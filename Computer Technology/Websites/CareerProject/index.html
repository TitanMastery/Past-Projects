		<p>A web developer's main job is to design, develop, and maintain websites for companies and businesses. They have to build the site with code and organize the way it appears. Web developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building sites. They also have to make sure that the site is able to perform under the estimated amount of traffic visiting it. If the traffic is too great for the site, it can cause a DOS attack. Some companies may even have the web developer write the content found on the site.</p>
