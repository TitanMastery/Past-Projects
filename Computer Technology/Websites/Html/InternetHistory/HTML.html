			Hypertext Markup Language(HTML) is the standard markup language used for creating most web pages and applications. HTML was created in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee. Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is a style sheet language that helps determine how documents written in a markup language should be organized. CSS was created by Håkon Wium Lie in 1996. Both Lie and Berners-Lee worked at CERN.

			HTML, CSS, and a third language, JavaScript, combine to create almost every website on the internet. HTML is used to build the web page, CSS is used to organize it and make it more presentable, and JavaScript is used to make the web page more interactive by providing an object-based language to create online programs. HTML only allows for the composition of text and images on a web page. While CSS allows there to be a more advanced layout, colors, font, etc.

			HTML and CSS are relevant to the history of the internet because they helped build almost everything that exists on the internet today. Without them we would be lacking coding languages that make building web pages simplistic and easy. The internet would not have grown as popular if these coding languages weren’t developed.
