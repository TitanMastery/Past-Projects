<h1 align="center"><u>What I Did This Summer</u></h1>

<hr width="65%"><br>

<p>I spent most of my summer playing video games. I restarted one of my old destiny clans and we now have 20 active members. I beat the game on my titan as well.</p>

<p>I also spent a lot of time at work. I work at gerbes west as a courtesy clerk/cashier. It was very uncomfortable due to the heat and humidity.</p>

<p>I went to the University of Demolay, which is a leadership training conference. We did lots of team-building activities and athletic competitions.</p>

<p>I also went back up to Iowa while my dad attended his high school reunion. I got to hang out with my cousins, and grandmother. We went fishing and geode hunting in a creek.</p>/
